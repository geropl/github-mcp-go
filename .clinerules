# GitHub MCP Go Project Rules

## Project Patterns

### Code Organization
- Go package structure follows standard Go conventions
- Tools are organized by GitHub resource type (repository, pulls, files, etc.)
- Each tool type has its own file in pkg/tools/
- Implementation details are in pkg/github/

### Naming Conventions
- Tool names use snake_case (e.g., create_pull_request)
- Go functions and methods use CamelCase
- Constants use UPPERCASE
- Test cases use descriptive names that indicate what's being tested

### Error Handling
- Custom error types in pkg/errors/
- GitHub API errors are converted to MCP-compatible errors
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Logging with logrus for context

## Testing Patterns

### Iterative Approach
- Focus on one test case at a time
- Make each test case work completely before moving to the next
- Start with "happy path" test cases before error cases
- Comment out test cases that aren't ready to be implemented yet

### Test Structure
- Table-driven tests with TestCase structs
- Each test case has a Name, Tool, and Input
- Test cases are run in a loop with t.Run()
- RunTest function handles test execution and comparison

### VCR Usage
- Use -record flag to record new HTTP interactions
- Default to replay mode for deterministic testing
- Sanitize sensitive information in cassettes
- Cassettes are stored in testdata/cassette/

### Golden Files
- Use -golden flag to update golden files
- Golden files store expected test results in JSON format
- Golden files are stored in testdata/golden/
- Compare actual results against golden files during testing

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Order
1. Define tool schema and register with MCP server
2. Implement GitHub operations in pkg/github/
3. Implement tool handler in pkg/tools/
4. Add test cases in pkg/tools/*_test.go
5. Run tests with -record flag to create cassettes
6. Run tests with -golden flag to create golden files
7. Run tests without flags to verify functionality

### Testing Workflow
1. Uncomment one test case at a time
2. Run test with -record flag to create cassette
3. Run test with -golden flag to create golden file
4. Run test without flags to verify it passes
5. Move to the next test case

## User Preferences

### Testing Focus
- Prefer thorough testing over quick implementation
- Take an iterative approach to testing
- Ensure each test case works completely before moving on
- Document test cases clearly

### Documentation
- Keep memory bank files up to date
- Document testing approach and progress
- Update progress.md with current status
- Update activeContext.md with current focus
