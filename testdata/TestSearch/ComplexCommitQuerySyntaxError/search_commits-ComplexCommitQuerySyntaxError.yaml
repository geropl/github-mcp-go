filters in rules not applying correctly (#7025)\n\n### WHY\r\nThe language filters users can specify for rules (i.e., via `lang: go`)\r\nare not currently applying correctly. Currently, a `*.rule.md` file\r\nmarked with `lang: go` does not apply to Go files.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"512\" alt=\"image\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51525093-6b5c-4c2d-8a7e-867b22ba78ef\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<img width=\"921\" alt=\"image\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce75431-a1d1-4ed0-9ca3-613b1055268d\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n_The `Check repo permissions in handlers` rule is not applying to the\r\ncurrent `Go` file, even though `lang: go` is specified_\r\n \r\n### WHAT\r\nFix the matching logic for language filters to compare case-insensitive\r\nstrings instead of attempting to match via regex. This is for two\r\nreasons:\r\n- The filters `go` and `Go` should both match a file like `test.go`.\r\nCurrently only `Go` would match\r\n- Using regex would require escaping special characters for languages\r\nlike `C++` (because `+` is a special character). We want an exact match\r\nbetween language filter and language name anyways\r\n\r\n<img width=\"719\" alt=\"image\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b81d7eb2-fe12-4b18-9ba3-af3a082f8097\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n_The `Check repo permissions in handlers` now correctly applies to the\r\ncurrent `Go` file_\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nUpdated unit tests in `filters.test.ts` to include more extensive tests\r\nof language filters:\r\n- Correctly capitalized `testFile`''s `languages` field to reflect how\r\nlanguages are [represented in\r\n`EXTENSION_TO_LANGUAGE`](https://sourcegraph.sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/cody/-/blob/lib/shared/src/common/languages.ts)\r\n(this is why the bug was not caught earlier)\r\n- Add tests for languages with special characters (C++)\r\n- Add tests for languages whose names are substrings of other languages\r\n(C and C++, Java and JavaScript, etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso tested locally via debugger; ensured rules apply correctly to files\r\nof the same language and are ignored for files of different languages.\r\n\r\n<!-- Required.
