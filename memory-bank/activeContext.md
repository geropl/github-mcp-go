# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the initial phase of porting the GitHub MCP server from TypeScript to Go. We have:

1. Set up the project structure
2. Implemented the core server functionality
3. Created the GitHub client integration
4. Implemented repository operations tools
5. Implemented pull request operations tools (including the new tools requested)
6. Implemented file operations tools

The current focus is on:

1. Implementing the remaining tools (issue operations, branch operations, search operations, commit operations)
2. Adding tests for all tools

## Recent Changes

- Created project structure
- Initialized Go module
- Added dependencies (mcp-go, go-github, logrus)
- Implemented core server functionality
- Created GitHub client wrapper
- Implemented error handling utilities
- Implemented repository operations tools
- Implemented pull request operations tools (including the new tools requested)
- Implemented file operations tools
- Created README

## Next Steps

1. Implement issue operations tools
2. Implement branch operations tools
3. Implement search operations tools
4. Implement commit operations tools
5. Add tests for all tools

## Active Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Using logrus for structured logging
   - Created custom error types for different error categories
   - Providing detailed error messages for troubleshooting

2. **Authentication**
   - Using GitHub personal access token for authentication
   - Token is provided via environment variable
   - Added validation for token presence

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Will use go-vcr for recording HTTP interactions
   - Will implement table-driven tests
   - Will create fixtures for each API interaction

4. **Tool Implementation Priority**
   - Repository operations (completed)
   - Pull request operations (completed)
   - File operations (completed)
   - Issue operations (next)
   - Branch operations
   - Search operations
   - Commit operations

## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring proper error handling and conversion between GitHub API errors and MCP errors
2. Implementing proper validation for tool inputs
3. Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
