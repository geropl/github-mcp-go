# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the initial phase of porting the GitHub MCP server from TypeScript to Go. We have:

1. Set up the project structure
2. Implemented the core server functionality
3. Created the GitHub client integration
4. Implemented repository operations tools
5. Implemented pull request operations tools (including the new tools requested)
6. Implemented file operations tools
7. Set up the testing framework with go-vcr and golden files

The current focus is on:

1. **Implementing tests in an iterative manner**:
   - Starting with pull request operations tests
   - Currently focusing on making the "SuccessfulCreation" test case for create_pull_request work
   - Following an approach of making one test case work before moving to the next
   - Other test cases are defined but commented out until we're ready to implement them

2. Once testing is complete for pull request operations:
   - Implementing the remaining tools (issue operations, branch operations, search operations, commit operations)
   - Adding tests for the remaining tools

## Recent Changes

- Created project structure
- Initialized Go module
- Added dependencies (mcp-go, go-github, logrus, go-vcr)
- Implemented core server functionality
- Created GitHub client wrapper
- Implemented error handling utilities
- Implemented repository operations tools
- Implemented pull request operations tools (including the new tools requested)
- Implemented file operations tools
- Set up testing framework with go-vcr and golden files
- Started implementing pull request tests with an iterative approach
- Created README

## Next Steps

1. Complete the "SuccessfulCreation" test case for create_pull_request
2. Uncomment and implement the next test case for pull request operations
3. Continue iteratively implementing test cases for pull request operations
4. Implement issue operations tools
5. Implement branch operations tools
6. Implement search operations tools
7. Implement commit operations tools
8. Add tests for the remaining tools (issue, branch, search, commit operations)
9. Add end-to-end tests

## Active Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Using logrus for structured logging
   - Created custom error types for different error categories
   - Providing detailed error messages for troubleshooting

2. **Authentication**
   - Using GitHub personal access token for authentication
   - Token is provided via environment variable
   - Added validation for token presence

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Using go-vcr for recording HTTP interactions
   - Implemented table-driven tests with golden files
   - Created test fixtures for repository, pull request, and file operations
   - Using dummy tokens for playback mode
   - Sanitizing sensitive information in cassettes
   - Taking an iterative approach: make one test case work, then move to the next
   - Starting with the "happy path" test cases before error cases

4. **Tool Implementation Priority**
   - Repository operations (completed)
   - Pull request operations (completed)
   - File operations (completed)
   - Issue operations (next)
   - Branch operations
   - Search operations
   - Commit operations

## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring proper error handling and conversion between GitHub API errors and MCP errors
2. Implementing proper validation for tool inputs
3. Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
4. Managing test fixtures and cassettes for deterministic testing
5. Balancing the iterative testing approach with comprehensive coverage
