# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have released v0.3.0 with all GitHub Actions tools following PRD 001-action-tools (100% complete). All read-only tools for GitHub Actions workflows are now fully implemented, tested, and included in the official release.

Current priorities:
1. **Testing completion**
   - Repository operations tests need completion (50% done)
   - All other test categories are complete

2. **End-to-end testing preparation**

3. **Planning for next feature set**

## Recent Changes

- Released v0.3.0 with GitHub Actions tools:
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md to document the new GitHub Actions tools
  - Updated README.md to include the GitHub Actions tools in the Available Tools section
  - Created and pushed git tag v0.3.0 to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow for building and publishing the release
  - Updated memory bank files to reflect the new state of the project
- Completed test verification for all GitHub Actions tools:
  - Verified all test cases have been run with the `-record` flag to create cassettes
  - Verified all test cases have been run with the `-golden` flag to create golden files
  - Verified all test cases pass in normal mode
  - Verified test directories exist in testdata/ for all test cases

## Next Steps

1. Complete repository operations tests for create_repository and fork_repository

2. Plan for end-to-end testing

3. Plan and implement next feature set (potentially "get_diff" tool)

4. Monitor the release process and address any issues that arise

## Active Decisions

1. **Feature Development Process**
   - Using PRDs to document requirements and track implementation progress
   - PRDs are numbered sequentially and stored in the `prds/` directory
   - Implementation status is tracked within each PRD

2. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Using logrus for structured logging
   - Custom error types for different error categories
   - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

3. **Authentication**
   - GitHub personal access token via environment variable
   - Validation for token presence

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Iterative: one test case at a time, starting with "happy path"
   - Using go-vcr for recording HTTP interactions
   - Golden files for expected results
   - Comprehensive test cases for all tools

5. **Response Formatting**
   - Markdown formatting for all tool responses
   - Formatters for each GitHub resource type
   - Clear, readable format with headers and sections

## Current Challenges

1. Completing repository operations tests
2. Planning and implementing end-to-end testing
3. Ensuring proper error handling between GitHub API and MCP errors
4. Implementing proper validation for tool inputs
5. Managing test fixtures and cassettes for deterministic testing
6. Handling GitHub API permissions for tests requiring write access
7. Planning and implementing the next feature set

## Test Verification

For detailed testing instructions, refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

### Completed Tool Verifications

The following tools have been fully implemented and tested according to the Definition of Done criteria in TESTING.md:

#### GitHub Actions Tools
- ✓ download_workflow_run_logs
- ✓ list_workflow_jobs
- ✓ get_workflow_job
- ✓ list_workflow_runs
- ✓ get_workflow_run
- ✓ list_workflows
- ✓ get_workflow

All test cases for these tools have been verified with the `-record` and `-golden` flags, and all pass in normal mode. Test directories exist in testdata/ for all test cases, and test status has been updated in progress.md.
