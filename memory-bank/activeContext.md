# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the initial phase of porting the GitHub MCP server from TypeScript to Go. We have:

1. Set up the project structure
2. Implemented the core server functionality
3. Created the GitHub client integration
4. Implemented repository operations tools
5. Implemented pull request operations tools (including the new tools requested)
6. Implemented file operations tools
7. Set up the testing framework with go-vcr and golden files

The current focus is on:

1. **Implementing comprehensive tests for repository and file operations**:
   - Defined test cases for repository operations tools
   - Following the same iterative approach used for pull request tests
   - Organizing test cases by tool and type (happy path vs. error cases)
   - Implementing tests for search_repositories tool
   - Documenting limitations with create_repository and fork_repository tests

2. Once testing is complete for repository and file operations:
   - Implementing the remaining tools (issue operations, branch operations, search operations, commit operations)
   - Adding tests for the remaining tools

## Next Steps

1. Implement tests for remaining tools (issue, branch, search, commit operations)
2. Implement issue operations tools
3. Implement branch operations tools
4. Implement search operations tools
5. Implement commit operations tools
6. Add tests for the remaining tools (issue, branch, search, commit operations)
7. Add end-to-end tests

## Active Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Using logrus for structured logging
   - Created custom error types for different error categories
   - Providing detailed error messages for troubleshooting

2. **Authentication**
   - Using GitHub personal access token for authentication
   - Token is provided via environment variable
   - Added validation for token presence

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Using go-vcr for recording HTTP interactions
   - Implemented table-driven tests with golden files
   - Created test fixtures for repository, pull request, and file operations
   - Using dummy tokens for playback mode
   - Sanitizing sensitive information in cassettes
   - Taking an iterative approach: make one test case work, then move to the next
   - Starting with the "happy path" test cases before error cases
   - Documenting the testing process in detail for future reference

4. **Tool Implementation Priority**
   - Repository operations (completed)
   - Pull request operations (completed)
   - File operations (completed)
   - Issue operations (next)
   - Branch operations
   - Search operations
   - Commit operations

5. **Response Formatting**
   - Using markdown formatting for all tool responses instead of raw JSON
   - Created formatters for each GitHub resource type (pull requests, repositories, files, etc.)
   - Selecting only the most relevant fields for each resource type
   - Organizing information in a clear, readable format with headers and sections

## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring proper error handling and conversion between GitHub API errors and MCP errors
2. Implementing proper validation for tool inputs
3. Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
4. Managing test fixtures and cassettes for deterministic testing
5. Balancing the iterative testing approach with comprehensive coverage
6. Maintaining consistent test case organization across different tools
7. Handling limitations with GitHub API permissions for tests that require write access
