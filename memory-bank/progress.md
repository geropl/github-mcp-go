## What Works

- Memory bank documentation is set up
- Project structure is created
- Go module is initialized
- Dependencies are added
- Core server functionality is implemented
- GitHub client wrapper is created
- Error handling utilities are implemented
- Repository operations tools are implemented
- Pull request operations tools are implemented (including the new tools requested)
- File operations tools are implemented
- Testing framework is set up with:
  - Table-driven test structure
  - go-vcr for recording HTTP interactions
  - Golden files for expected results
  - Test helpers for running tests
- Currently working on the first pull request test case (SuccessfulCreation)
- README is created

## What's Left to Build

1. **Tool Implementations**
   - Issue operations
   - Branch operations
   - Search operations
   - Commit operations

2. **Testing**
   - Complete pull request operations tests:
     - Make "SuccessfulCreation" test case work
     - Implement error test cases for create_pull_request
     - Implement test cases for get_pull_request
     - Implement test cases for get_pull_request_diff
   - Implement repository operations tests
   - Implement file operations tests
   - Implement tests for remaining tools (issue, branch, search, commit operations)
   - Add end-to-end tests

## Known Issues

- None yet

## Current Testing Focus

We're taking an iterative approach to testing:
1. Make one test case work completely
2. Only then move to the next test case
3. Start with "happy path" test cases before error cases

Current focus: Make the "SuccessfulCreation" test case for create_pull_request work

## Next Milestone

**Milestone 2: Complete Pull Request Testing**
- Make "SuccessfulCreation" test case work
- Implement remaining pull request test cases
- Ensure all pull request operations are thoroughly tested

Target Completion: TBD

**Milestone 3: Remaining Tool Implementations**
- Implement issue operations tools
- Implement branch operations tools
- Implement search operations tools
- Implement commit operations tools

Target Completion: TBD
