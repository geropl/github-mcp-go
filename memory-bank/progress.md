## What's Left to Build

1. **Tool Implementations**
   - Branch operations
   - Search operations
   - Commit operations

2. **Testing**
   - Complete repository operations tests:
     - Implement tests for create_repository (requires token with write permissions)
     - Implement tests for fork_repository (requires token with write permissions)
   - Complete issue operations tests:
     - Run tests for all issue operations tools
     - Create golden files for issue operations
   - Implement tests for remaining tools (branch, search, commit operations)
   - Add end-to-end tests

## Known Issues

- None yet

## Current Testing Focus

We're taking an iterative approach to testing:
1. Make one test case work completely
2. Only then move to the next test case
3. Start with "happy path" test cases before error cases

Current focus: Implement tests for repository operations and branch operations

## Next Milestone

**Milestone 2: Complete Repository Operations Testing**
- Implement tests for all repository operations tools
- Follow the iterative approach outlined in the testing documentation

Target Completion: TBD

**Milestone 3: Remaining Tool Implementations**
- Implement branch operations tools
- Implement search operations tools
- Implement commit operations tools

Target Completion: TBD
