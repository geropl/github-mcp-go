## What's Left to Build

1. **GitHub Actions Tools (PRD 001-action-tools)**
   - Continue implementing GitHub Actions API operations in pkg/github/actions.go
   - Continue implementing GitHub Actions tools in pkg/tools/actions.go
   - Implement the following tools:
     - list_workflow_runs: List workflow runs for a repository or a specific workflow
     - get_workflow_run: Get detailed information about a specific workflow run
     - download_workflow_run_logs: Download and process the logs for a workflow run
     - list_workflow_jobs: List jobs for a workflow run
     - get_workflow_job: Get detailed information about a specific job
   - Create tests for the remaining GitHub Actions tools

2. **Testing**
   - Complete repository operations tests:
     - Implement tests for create_repository (requires token with write permissions)
     - Implement tests for fork_repository (requires token with write permissions)
   - Add end-to-end tests

2. **Release Process**
   - Create first official release using the new GitHub release workflow
   - Test the release process with a tag push

3. **Enhancements**
   - Consider adding more advanced search features
   - Improve error handling for edge cases
   - Add more comprehensive documentation for search operations

## Known Issues

- None yet

## Current Testing Focus

We're taking an iterative approach to testing:
1. Make one test case work completely
2. Only then move to the next test case
3. Start with "happy path" test cases before error cases

Current focus: 
- Complete repository operations tests for create_repository and fork_repository (requires token with write permissions)
- Plan for end-to-end testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly
- Search operations tests have been completed with the addition of the "type" parameter to search_issues to fix GitHub API requirements

## Next Milestone

**Milestone 2: GitHub Actions Tools Implementation**
- Implement all GitHub Actions tools as specified in PRD 001-action-tools
- Create tests for all GitHub Actions tools
- Document the implementation in the PRD

Target Completion: TBD

**Milestone 3: Complete Repository Operations Testing**
- Implement tests for all repository operations tools
- Follow the iterative approach outlined in the testing documentation

Target Completion: TBD

**Milestone 4: End-to-End Testing**
- Implement end-to-end tests for the entire MCP server
- Test all tools together in realistic scenarios
- Ensure proper error handling across all components

Target Completion: TBD
