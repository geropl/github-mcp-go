# Product Context

## Purpose

The GitHub MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with the GitHub API. It allows AI assistants to perform GitHub operations on behalf of users, such as:

- Managing repositories
- Working with files
- Creating and managing issues
- Creating and managing pull requests
- Working with branches
- Searching GitHub
- Managing commits

## Problems Solved

1. **AI GitHub Integration**: Enables AI assistants to interact with GitHub directly, allowing them to perform tasks that would otherwise require manual user intervention.

2. **Standardized GitHub Operations**: Provides a consistent interface for GitHub operations through the MCP protocol, abstracting away the complexities of the GitHub API.

3. **Secure Authentication**: Handles GitHub authentication securely, allowing AI assistants to perform operations on behalf of users without exposing sensitive credentials.

4. **Efficient Workflow**: Streamlines development workflows by allowing AI assistants to create repositories, manage files, create pull requests, and more, directly from the conversation.

## How It Works

1. **MCP Protocol**: The server implements the Model Context Protocol, which defines a standard way for AI assistants to interact with external tools and resources.

2. **GitHub API Integration**: The server uses the go-github library to interact with the GitHub API, providing a Go-based implementation of the GitHub MCP server.

3. **Tool Definitions**: The server defines a set of tools that AI assistants can use to perform GitHub operations, each with a specific purpose and input schema.

4. **Authentication**: The server uses GitHub personal access tokens for authentication, which are provided via environment variables.

5. **Error Handling**: The server provides structured error handling, converting GitHub API errors into MCP-compatible error responses.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Seamless Integration**: Users should be able to interact with GitHub through AI assistants without having to switch contexts or manually perform operations.

2. **Reliability**: The server should handle GitHub API operations reliably, with proper error handling and recovery.

3. **Security**: User credentials should be handled securely, with no exposure of sensitive information.

4. **Extensibility**: The server should be easily extensible to support new GitHub operations as needed.

5. **Performance**: The server should perform operations efficiently, minimizing latency and resource usage.

## Target Users

1. **AI Assistants**: The primary users of the server are AI assistants that need to interact with GitHub on behalf of users.

2. **Developers**: The server is designed to be used by developers who want to integrate GitHub operations into their AI-powered workflows.

3. **DevOps Teams**: Teams that want to automate GitHub operations as part of their development and deployment processes.

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All GitHub operations are implemented correctly and work as expected.

2. **Reliability**: The server handles errors gracefully and provides helpful error messages.

3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures that all operations work correctly.

4. **Documentation**: Clear documentation makes it easy for users to understand and use the server.

5. **Performance**: Operations are performed efficiently with minimal latency.
