# GitHub MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for GitHub, implemented in Go. This server allows LLMs to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more through a standardized interface.

## Features

- **Comprehensive GitHub API Access**: See [Tools](#available-tools) below
- **Setup Command**: Easy automatic setup for AI assistants
  - `--auto-approve` allows to pre-fill the auto-approval checkbox
  - `--write-access` enables write access for remote operations
  - Copies the binary into a stable location
  - Updates the tool MCP server config (cline and claude-desktop are supported)
- **Security Controls**:
  - Write access is disabled by default for safety
  - Fine-grained auto-approval options

## Planned Features

- [ ] "get_diff"
  - diff between two commits
  - ? Should this be in the output of `compare_commits`?


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions

### Using Pre-built Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/geropl/github-mcp-go/releases) page.

```bash
# Download the latest release - for "linux_amd64" in this case
RELEASE="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/geropl/github-mcp-go/releases/latest)"
DOWNLOAD_URL="$(echo $RELEASE | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains("linux_amd64")) | .browser_download_url')"
curl -L -o ./github-mcp-go $DOWNLOAD_URL
chmod +x ./github-mcp-go

# Setup the mcp server (can be called in .gitpod.yml, dotfiles repo, etc.)
./github-mcp-go setup --write-access="${GITHUB_MCP_WRITE_ACCESS:-false}" --auto-approve=allow-read-only || true
rm -f ./github-mcp-go
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.23 or later

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geropl/github-mcp-go.git
cd github-mcp-go

# Build the server
go build -o github-mcp-go .
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables

The server requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to authenticate with the GitHub API:

```bash
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Setup

The server includes a convenient setup command to install and configure the MCP server for use with AI assistants:

```bash
# Set up for Cline with auto-approval for read-only tools
./github-mcp-go setup --auto-approve allow-read-only --tool cline

# Set up for Claude Desktop with auto-approval for specific tools
./github-mcp-go setup --auto-approve search_repositories,get_file_contents --tool claude-desktop

# Set up with write access enabled
./github-mcp-go setup --write-access --tool cline

# Show setup help
./github-mcp-go setup --help
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Run the server directly (read-only mode)
./github-mcp-go serve

# Run the server with write access enabled
./github-mcp-go serve --write-access

# Show help
./github-mcp-go --help
```

#### Auto-Approval Options

The `--auto-approve` flag can be used to specify which tools should be auto-approved as a comma-separated list. `allow-read-only` is a special value to add all read-only tools to the auto-approve list (safe, no state changes).

The `--write-access` flag enables write access for remote operations. This allows tools that modify remote repositories to be used. By default, write access is disabled for safety.
